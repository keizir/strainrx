            Indicas are thought of as having originated from a region of the Middle East (and possibly Central Asia
            before that), specifically the mountain ranges of Afghanistan appropriately called The Hindu Kush mountains.
            Growing in such a tough environment, characterized by a harsh and variable climate, has forced the plant to
            develop a thick and bushy coat of resin as a defense against the elements. Indica tends to be shorter, has
            wider leaves, and is a more resilient plant compared to its
            <a href="{% url 'search:strains_sativa_root' %}">Sativa</a> counterpart. It also has a shorter flowering
            cycle. Additionally, indicas tend to emit a stronger, more pungent fragrance compared to an indica plant.

        <div class="text">
            Indicas are also differentiated by higher THC content and they produce more relaxing and sedating effects
            that can be felt throughout the entire body (as opposed to being limited to cerebral effects and experienced
            mainly in the head). Medicating with indicas is a great option for people who seek pain relief, want to
            alleviate muscle spasms, treat insomnia, or deal with anxiety issues. A typical yield on an indica plant
            ranges from 1.5 â€“ 2.5 ounces.

            As for naming the various indica strains, it is common to see the word "Kush" included in the title, which
            happens to be a reliable indicator of indica or indica-dominant genetics. The moniker is used as a token of
            respect or homage to the original source of the plant.

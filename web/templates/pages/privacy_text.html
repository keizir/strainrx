        <div class="sub-paragraph">
            Please ensure that you read this Privacy Policy carefully, as it is a legally binding
            contract between the applicable StrainRx entity that owns the applicable Website or provides the applicable
            Services that you may be accessing or using, on the one hand, and you and your successors and heirs, and (if
            applicable) the corporate entity that you represent (in this Privacy Policy, you shall be referred to as
            "you" or "your"), on the other hand. By accessing or using any of the Websites or Services, you are agreeing
            to be legally bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept and agree to this Privacy Policy, you may

            This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional changes from time to time, and should we
            make any material changes, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail communication to the last e-mail
            address you provided to us and/or by prominently posting a notice of the changes on the Websites. Any
            changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon the earlier of our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you

            us with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to us is no
            longer valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch
            of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described
            in the notice. If your e-mail address is not up to date or is not working, the posting of a notice of
            changes to this Privacy Policy on the Websites shall constitute effective notice of the changes described
            therein. Continued use of any of the Websites or Services following notice of such changes shall indicate
            your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
            We may also post additional privacy policies or statements that apply to certain portions of the Websites or

            <h4 class="header">Information We May Collect</h4>
            This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect. Among the information we collect, please
            note:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Account Information: If you create an account on any of the Websites or Services (a “User Account”),
                    we may store and use your full name, email address, zip code, and other information you may provide
                    with your User Account, such as your gender and birth date. Your first name and last initial, as
                    well as any photo you submit through the registration process, may be publicly displayed as part of
                    your User Account profile.
                </li>
                <li>Public Content: The information that you contribute through or post on the Websites or Services is
                    intended for public consumption, including your reviews, tips, photos, videos, check-ins, comments,
                    likes, posts, events, bookmarks, friends, lists, compliments, and basic User Account profile
                    information. We may display this information through the Websites or Services, share it with
                    businesses, and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services.
                </li>
                <li>Communications: When you sign up for a User Account or use certain features, you are opting to
                    receive messages from other StrainRx users, businesses, and StrainRx itself. While you can manage
                    some of your email preferences, please note that you cannot opt-out of receiving certain
                    administrative, transactional, or legal messages from StrainRx. We may also track your actions in
                    response to the messages you receive from StrainRx or through the Websites or Services, such as
                    whether you deleted, opened, or forwarded such messages. If you exchange messages with others
                    through the Websites or Services, we may store them in order to process and deliver them, allow you
                    to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in connection with investigations related to the
                    operation and use of the Websites or Services. We may not deliver messages that we believe are
                    objectionable, such as spam messages or requests to exchange reviews for compensation. If you send
                    or receive messages through the Websites or Services via SMS text message, we may log phone numbers,
                    phone carriers, and the date and time that the messages were processed. Carriers may charge
                    recipients for texts that they receive. We may also store information that you provide through
                    communications to us, including from phone calls, letters, emails and other electronic messages, or
                    in person. If you are a representative of a business listed on StrainRx, we may contact you,
                    including by phone or email, using the contact information you provide us, make publicly available,
                    or that we have on record for your business.
                </li>
                <li>Transactional Information: If you initiate a transaction through any of our Websites or Services, to
                    the extent applicable (the “Transactable Sites”), we may collect and store information about you,
                    such as your name, phone number, address, email, and credit card information, as well as any other
                    information you provide to us, in order to process your transaction, send communications about them
                    to you, and populate forms for future transactions. This information may be shared with third
                    parties for the same purposes. StrainRx does not disclose your personal information to third parties
                    for the purpose of directly marketing their services to you unless you first agree to such
                    disclosure that may advertise content directly to you on behalf of such parties. When you submit
                    credit card numbers, we encrypt that information using industry standard technology. If you write
                    reviews about businesses with which you transact through the Websites or Services, we may publicly
                    display the fact that you transacted with those businesses.

                            communicate with you regarding purchases and any issues that may arise in connection with

                            of goods and services purchased from you and any issues that may arise in connection with
                            their purchase. This personal information includes the seller information provided during
                            your listing or vendor registration and your e-mail address. When you make a purchase
                            through the Transactable Sites, we may collect and maintain personal information from you,
                            such as your name, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number,

                            fulfillment of your order, to facilitate the communication with you about your order and to
                            send you promotional materials. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity
                            to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it
                            contains and these changes will be automatically kept for future use. We may require
                            additional verifications or information from you before accepting any order.

            Third parties may receive information about you as follows:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Advertisers:  We may allow third parties to use Cookies through the Websites or Services to collect
                    the same type of information for the same purposes as StrainRx does for itself. In doing so,
                    StrainRx adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online
                    Behavioral Advertising. Third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with
                    other information they have about you from other sources. We do not necessarily have access to or
                    control over the Cookies they use, but you may be able to opt out of some of their practices by
                    visiting the following links:
                    <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a>,
                    <a href="http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/web-analytics.html" target="_blank">Omniture</a>, and
                    <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>. 
                    Please note that opting out does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you.
                    Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information from or about you with third
                    parties, such as location data, advertising identifiers, or a cryptographic hash of a common User
                    Account identifier (such as an email address), to facilitate the display of targeted advertising.
                    You may be able to limit our sharing of some of this information through your mobile device
                    settings, as described in Section 2 above.
                </li>
                <li>Service Providers:  We may rely on third party providers to support or provide some of the features
                    and options that are available through the Websites, Services or Transactable Sites. We may also
                    rely on third party providers to perform certain services for us in connection with your use of the
                    Websites or Services, such as communications and hosting services, network security, technical and
                    customer support, tracking and reporting functions, quality assurance testing, payment processing,
                    our own marketing of the Websites or Services, promotional and contest features, Transactable Sites’
                    product listings and brand management, and other functions. We may share information from or about
                    you with these third party providers so that they can perform their services or complete your
                    requests. These third party providers may share information with us that they obtain from or about
                    you in connection with providing their services or completing your requests. Third party providers
                    may also share this information with their subsidiaries, joint ventures, affiliates, partners or
                    other companies under common control. Some of our web pages utilize framing techniques to serve
                    content to you from our third party providers, while preserving the look and feel of the Websites or
                    Services. In such cases, please note that the information you provide is being provided to the third
                    party.
                </li>
                <li>Aggregate Information:  We may share user information in the aggregate with third parties, such as
                    advertisers, brand managers and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of
                    users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertisements, or certain products available in the
                    Transactable Sites or the general characteristics of such users.
                </li>
                <li>Business Transfers:  We may share information from or about you with our subsidiaries, affiliates,
                    partners, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require
                    them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires StrainRx or all or substantially all
                    of our assets, that company will possess the same information, and will assume the rights and
                    obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
                </li>
                <li>Businesses on StrainRx:  We may share information from or about you (such as your age and gender),
                    your devices, and your use of the Websites, Services and/or Transactable Sites (such as which
                    businesses you bookmark or call) with businesses listed on StrainRx. You may adjust your settings to
                    increase or decrease the amount of information we share. Keep in mind that businesses may see your
                    Public Content (as defined in Section 2(b) above) and receive information about your transactions
                    with them in the Transactable Sites, regardless of your settings. Additionally, if you make a phone
                    call to a business through or in connection with your use of the Websites or Services, we may share
                    basic information about your call with the business that you contacted, such as the date and time of
                    your call and your phone number (and other information that would have been available to the
                    business had you contacted them directly, and not through the Websites or Services). You may be able
                    to limit our ability to collect and share your phone number through your phone’s settings or phone
                    service provider.
                </li>
                <li>Investigations:  We may investigate and disclose information from or about you if we have a good
                    faith belief that such investigation or disclosure: (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with
                    federal, state or local legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search
                    warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on us; (b) is helpful
                    to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Websites, Services
                    or Transactable Sites; or (c) protects our rights, reputation, property, or that of our users,
                    affiliates, clients, partners or the public, such as disclosures in connection with our Consumer
                    Alerts program. If you flag or otherwise complain to StrainRx about content available through the
                    Websites, Services or items on the Transactable Sites, we may share the substance of your complaint
                    with the contributor of that content or product in order to provide an opportunity for the
                    contributor to respond and/or remedy the situation.
                </li>
                <li>Links:  The Websites or Services may contain links to unaffiliated third party services. Except as
                    set forth herein, we do not share your personal information with them, and are not responsible for
                    their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy policies on or applicable to all such third
                    party services.
                </li>
                <li>Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions: We may sometimes offer sweepstakes, contests, and other
                    promotions (any, a "Promotion") through the Websites or Services that may require registration. By
                    participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion,
                    which may contain specific requirements of you, including, allowing the sponsor of the Promotion to
                    use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If
                    you choose to enter a Promotion, personal information may be disclosed to third parties or the
                    public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, in connection with winner
                    selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules,
                    such as on a winner’s list.
                </li>
            </ol>
            Please Note: If you agree to accept a Promotion from our third party service providers or any third party
            merchant, then you will receive e-mails separately from them and all information that you choose to disclose
            to them will be subject to their individual and separate privacy policies. If you later decide that you no
            longer want to receive their e-mails, then you will need to follow their own specific opt-out instructions.
            Following our directions for opting out of e-mail notifications and disclosure of personal information will
            not opt you out of third party disclosures and related promotional communications.

        <div class="sub-paragraph">We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the personal information
            you provide to us. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us,
            such as your contact information that was provided as part of your registration with our Websites or
            Services. The Websites or Services may allow you to review, correct or update personal information you have
            provided through the Websites or Services’ forms or otherwise. We will make good faith efforts to make
            requested changes in our then-active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that it is not
            always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual
            data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. Also, any public postings or other communications you
            have made on the Websites or Services such as in forums or blogs cannot generally be removed. When you edit
            your personal information or change your preferences on the Websites or Services, information that you
            remove may persist internally for our own administrative purposes.

            if your opt-out preferences are limited to certain types of e-mails, the opt-out will be so limited.
            Subsequent or different subscriptions will remain unaffected. Please note that we reserve the right to send
            you certain communications relating to your User Account or use of our Websites or Services, such as
            administrative and service announcements, and these transactional User Account messages may be unaffected

            associated with past purchases. Also, as a security measure, we “back up” the data stored on our systems,
            ensuring that such prior information cannot be completely removed from our databases. As a result, you
            should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our backed-up or

        <h3 class="header">13. Do Not Track</h3>
        <div class="sub-paragraph">StrainRx does track its customers over time and across third party websites to
            provide intelligent advertising, and does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals. In addition, some
            third party sites may keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them
            to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your web browser may allow you to set
            the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be
            tracked. Please review your web browser’s internet options for more details.

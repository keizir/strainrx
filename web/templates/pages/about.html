            <h2>For Patients</h2>

            <p>StrainRx is a resource for medical marijuana patients. We help users identify and locate cannabis strains
                ideally suited for specific purposes, be it to treat a condition or bring about some desirable effect
                that cannabis is known to produce.</p>

            <p>Our <a href="{% url 'search:strain_wizard' %}">recommendation engine</a> asks 4 questions to determine
                the user's ideal preferences. Based on the answers, a list of strains matching those preferences is
                generated. Think of this engine as a really smart bud-tender, capable of answering all of your questions
                at any time!</p>

            <p>Once our user knows what strains are optimal, it is time to find them! StrainRx enables the filtering of
                our recommendations based on a user's location, so that they could find their favorite buds whenever,
                and wherever they may be.</p>

            <p>To ensure that our menus are always accurate and up-to-date, we give users the power to modify vendor
                inventory, so that any patient who encounters an 'out of stock' issue can update the system in addition
                to providing ratings and reviews.</p>

            <p>We also introduce a dynamic feedback feature around strain details and can identify and incorporate
                significant changes automatically, ensuring that the knowledge base is always learning, improving, and
                reflecting patient preferences over time.</p>

            <p>With StrainRx, new as well as experienced patients can discover new strains, read and write reviews,
                compare prices, or find new vendors. The site also hosts one of the largest and most frequently updated
                cannabis databases on the internet and as such it is one of the best places to
                <a href="{% url 'home' %}">look up a strain</a> or find something new to try.</p>
